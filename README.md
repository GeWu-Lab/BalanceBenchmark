Learning multimodal representations involves integrating information from multiple heterogeneous sources of data. However, it is often hindered by the multimodal imbalance problem, where certain modalities dominate while others remain underutilized. To accelerate progress in addressing this challenge, we release BalanceMM, a standardized toolkit that implements various multimodal imbalance learning methods.
BalanceMM provides an automated end-to-end machine learning pipeline that simplifies and standardizes data loading, experimental setup, and model evaluation. The toolkit is designed to support research across different multimodal imbalance learning strategies, including data processing, feed-forward adjustments, objective modifications, and optimization approaches.
