## Paper
## Overview

Learning multimodal representations involves integrating information from multiple heterogeneous sources of data. However, it is often hindered by the multimodal imbalance problem, where certain modalities dominate while others remain underutilized. To accelerate progress in addressing this challenge, we release BalanceMM, a standardized toolkit that implements various multimodal imbalance learning methods.
